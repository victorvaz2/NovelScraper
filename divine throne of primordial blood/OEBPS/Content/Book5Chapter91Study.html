He unfurled his wings and flashed forwards like  lightning, flickering briefly before reappearing in front of the youth.  The youth hadnt expected his opponents speed to be that quick and was  totally caught off-guard. Su Chens fist slammed into his face, sending  him flying.</p><p>An instant later, Su Chen pounced and straddled him, unleashing a violent beating upon the young Harpy.</p><p>The youth was totally stunned by the vicious beating.</p><p>What was happening?</p><p>How was I hit by him?</p><p>He was not surprised that the other party had tried to attack him after he had pointed out their most humiliating experience.</p><p>Instead,  he was surprised that he hadnt actually been able to react, that he  was completely unable to mount a defense, that his opponent was  currently straddling him, and that he was being beaten to the point  where he had no strength to retaliate.</p><p>He  could only watch on as fist after fist came raining down on him,  causing flowers of blood to bloom. However, he had no strength to  retaliate, and he could only yell in shock and anger, Let go! Let go!  What are you guys still standing around and watching for!?</p><p>That last sentence was directed at the lackeys he had brought with him.</p><p>Those minions of him seemed to awaken from their reverie and charged forwards, attempting to pull Su Chen off of their leader.</p><p>Su Chen harrumphed and didnt try to resist. Instead, he bit down onto the fallen youths ear.</p><p>His bite was quite heavy, and the young Harpy howled with pain in response.</p><p>The  seven or eight Harpy subordinates surrounded Su Chen, but Su Chen  refused to let go. As he was pulled off of the youth, the youths ear  was also stretched longer and longer until it finally snapped off.</p><p>AHHH! The youths piercing howl rang out through the sky.</p><p>Harpies began to charge over from all directions when they heard this howl.</p><p>The  first one to arrive was a middle-aged Harpy. When he saw the bloody  scene before him, he was shocked. He barked, Halcyon Wing Streak, what  are you doing?</p><p>Second  Junior Uncle, make a judgment on my behalf! That bastard bit bit off  my ear, the youth howled as he clutched at his mangled ear.</p><p>Su  Chen recognized this Second Uncle. His name was Halcyon Wing Wind,  Halcyon Wing Mournings older brother, so he should have normally called  Halcyon Wing Wind Second Elder Uncle.</p><p>Su Chen was able to determine based on the youths cry that he was the son of the eldest uncle, Halcyon Wing Plume.</p><p>Su Chen finally realized who the youth in front of him was.</p><p>Halcyon Wing Whisper.</p><p>The  reason Su Chen hadnt recognized him was because Halcyon Wing Streak  hadn't listed him as an enemy, but rather as a follower.</p><p>Yes, Halcyon Wing Whisper had actually once been Halcyon Wing Streak's follower.</p><p>Even  though Halcyon Wing Whisper's father was Halcyon Wing Mourning's older  brother, Halcyon Wing Whisper was younger than Halcyon Wing Streak, and  his talent was also inferior. As a result, he had been relegated to the  status of a follower and minion. This was why Halcyon Wing Streak hadn't  referred to Halcyon Wing Whisper as an enemy when Su Chen had been  interrogating him, and why Su Chen hadn't been able to recognize him.</p><p>Unexpectedly,  this former follower had started a fight with him, even going so far as  to intentionally provoke him on sight. If Halcyon Wing Streak wasnt  lying, then that meant this youth had gotten stronger in recent years  and wanted to turn his former pillar into a stepping stone.</p><p>Su  Chen couldnt determine whether this was actually the case  these  opponents were all people he could suppress easily anyways. In his eyes,  a strong ant and a weak ant were both at the same level, and it was  hard for him to notice any difference in the two.</p><p>When Halcyon Wing Wind saw Halcyon Wing Whispers torn ear, the shock in his heart was palpable. Streak, what are you doing?</p><p>Su Chen remained silent, continuing to glare intently at Halcyon Wing Whisper, his gaze filled with rage and boundless hatred.</p><p>His acting skills werent half bad.</p><p>Unexpectedly,  he had learned this expression from Cloud Leopard. After all, no one  could compare with Cloud Leopard when it came to trying to kill an  opponent with a glare. Su Chen had copied Cloud Leopards stolid  woodenness, savagery, and tenacity  it could be almost said that he  was method acting.</p><p>Halcyon  Wing Wind was surprised when he saw Su Chens expression. He knew that  the situation was most likely not that simple, so he turned and asked  Halcyon Wing Whisper, What exactly happened?</p><p>Halcyon  Wing Whisper rubbed his neck as he explained, All I did was say  something about him, and then he went crazy and tried to bite me.</p><p>"What did you say about him?"</p><p>Halcyon Wing Whisper lowered his head and awkwardly said, "I said...... I said that he had been raped......"</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>Halcyon Wing Wind sucked in a mouthful of cold air.</p><p>All of the Harpies who had shown up on the scene by now had heard exactly what he said, including Halcyon Wing Mourning.</p><p>"What  did you say?" Halcyon Wing Mourning stared at Halcyon Wing Whisper,  aghast, before turning to look at his "son." Su Chen's expression seemed  to make it clear even without words that Halcyon Wing Whisper was  probably telling the truth.</p><p>He grabbed Halcyon Wing Whisper by the neck. "Who told you this?"</p><p>Halcyon  Wing Whisper choked out with great difficulty as he strained his neck,  "The other fifty-eight Harpies that came back with him...... They......  They all know...... I have a subordinate who is friends with one of  those captives, and he was the one who told me."</p><p>Halcyon Wing Mourning began to tremble. He turned to gaze at his son, finally understanding the source of his son's anger.</p><p>Anyone who went through something traumatic like that would probably go crazy upon having their wounds ripped open, right?</p><p>No wonder his son had suddenly become so aloof after returning.</p><p>He had actually experienced something as horrific as that.</p><p>"Bastard!" Halcyon Wing Plume slapped his son in the face. "How dare you even say something like that?"</p><p>Halcyon Wing Streak knew that he had committed a grave sin, but he still couldn't resist complaining. "He bit off my ear!"</p><p>"You  reap what you sow!" Halcyon Wing Plume glared at him as he sternly  ordered, "Go back and spend three days in confinement! Mourning, take  your son with you and let him rest."</p><p>"Yes!" Halcyon Wing Mourning obeyed and led Su Chen back to his room.</p><p>As he watched the father-son pair depart, Halcyon Wing Plume sighed regretfully.</p><p>He  knew that this incident had probably dealt a serious blow to Halcyon  Wing Streak. It was entirely possible that this would ruin him.</p><p>That being said, how had this kid managed to get on top of Halcyon Wing Whisper and beat him up so badly?</p><p>Halcyon  Wing Streak had been in captivity for a long time, so it was impossible  for him to have increased his strength by much, but he was still able  to defeat Halcyon Wing Whisper easily. There was only one possible  explanation, which was that Halcyon Wing Whisper had been slacking in  his cultivation lately.</p><p>Halcyon Wing Plume decided that he needed to whip this son of his into shape.</p><p>As  Halcyon Wing Whispers fate was being decided, he was still mourning  the loss of his ear. He had no idea that this was only the beginning of a  long nightmare for him.</p><p>That day became a day of silence for the Halcyon Wing Clan.</p><p>Many  Harpies soon found out about Halcyon Wing Streaks experiences, which  helped them understand his behavior. They ordered their subordinates to  not provoke Halcyon Wing Streak at any cost and did their best to  prevent news from spreading. At the same time, they gave Su Chen as much  freedom and space as possible, hoping that he would be able to recover  from his haze.</p><p>This was exactly what Su Chen wanted.</p><p>All  of his earlier preparations were now bearing fruit. Su Chen was totally  justified in his wildly different demeanor, so he was allowed to be  extreme, violent, irritable, and aloof. Even though he might be mocked  and ridiculed for this, he didnt care. After all, he wasnt Halcyon  Wing Streak, and even if he were, he wouldnt care either.</p><p>He was only after knowledge!</p><p>In the following days, Su Chen placed all of his focus into studying the Harpies system of knowledge.</p><p>The Halcyon Wing Clan had their own library.</p><p>This was where Su Chen liked to go the most.</p><p>He  spent his time here reading up on Harpy history and studying their  social structure. At the same time, he came to understand the Halcyon  Wing Clans structure even more clearly.</p><p>Because  he had the consciousness crystal, he could basically remember  everything he read, so his rate of reading comprehension was also  exceptionally quick. He merely had to flip through the pages rapidly  before putting them down. In just half a month, he had read through most  of the librarys books. Of course, Su Chens actions were just a form  of venting in the eyes of the other Harpies.</p><p>Somehow, he was relieving stress by flipping through these books chaotically.</p><p>The rumors about him only began to increase as a result, but Su Chen didnt mind.</p><p>He was very satisfied, as the Halcyon Wing Clans books were able to help him deepen his understanding of Arcana Techniques.</p><p>Su  Chen had known for quite some time that Arcana Techniques were  unleashed via Arcana Technique Patterns, with each technique  corresponding to a specific pattern. These patterns were in turn made up  of countless fragments. Because there was a general, foundational  structure to these patterns, their derivative fragments shared some  common attributes. For this reason, combining Arcana Technique Pattern  Fragments was almost like playing with toy building blocks. Thus, Arcana  Masters typically tried to master as many fragments as possible in  order to be able to quickly combine them into usable techniques.</p><p>To  increase the rate at which they mastered these fragments, some Arcana  Masters branded these patterns and fragments into their bodies.</p><p>This  was similar to a molding process. They essentially cast a specific  Arcana Technique through a mold, allowing them to then construct the  Arcana Technique Patterns much more rapidly. This was the reason why  certain Arcana Techniques were even usable in the first place.</p><p>Because  each individual possessed different physical attributes, the strength  of the brands differed wildly, as did the improvement in strength that  these Arcana Masters received from the branding.</p><p>Normally,  an Arcana Master could brand an additional fragment every time they  advanced a tier. These techniques were known as innate Arcana  Techniques.</p><p>This  was quite similar to the Humans Lotus Platform engraving, which relied  on similar principles to allow the user to rapidly unleash Origin  Skills. However, the Lotus Platforms branding was that of Origin Energy  Talismans, not Origin Energy Patterns, even though the overall  principles were quite similar. After all, this was something that the  humans had learned from the Arcanists in the first place.</p><p>Even  though there were innumerable cultivation systems under the heavens,  they all shared certain similarities, especially because the descendants  were usually heavily influenced by their ancestors.</p><p>However,  Arcana Masters could sometimes brand more than one pattern per tier.  Some of the more talented ones could even brand two innate Arcana  Techniques every tier; the level of branding was also incidentally the  measure that they used to define true talent.</p><p>Different  talents resulted in different results. Some people specialized in  quantity, allowing them to barrage enemies with a wide variety of Arcana  Techniques. Some people specialized in complexity, allowing them to  unleash a few incredibly powerful Arcana Techniques. In any case, the  world of Arcana Techniques was quite complicated, much more so than the  human system of Origin Skills.</p><p>The  only reason these techniques had been abandoned by humans was because  they were not very well suited for them due to their lack of processing  power.</p><p>However,  whereas most humans lacked in computing ability, Su Chen did not. His  memory and predictive abilities were extraordinary, even to the point  that he was superior to some Arcanists. As a result, his studies of  Arcana Techniques were extremely successful. Before, he had been  somewhat lacking in knowledge; all he had to work with was the knowledge  from some ancient dead Arcanists. This had not nearly been enough to  support his needs, but now that he was in Harpy territory, his eyes were  finally being opened.</p><p>Su  Chen began to ravenously devour all this information. He firmly  believed that he could turn these mountains of knowledge into jade, and  that not only would the complicated Arcana Techniques boost his  strength, they would also be incredibly useful to his research.</p><p>Su Chen immersed himself in this kind of study.</p><p>After half a month, Su Chen received a notice.</p><p>The human merchant group that had come to Flat Sky City had departed.</p><p>On that day, Su Chen knew that, from this moment onwards, he was going to be fighting this battle alone.</p></body></html>
